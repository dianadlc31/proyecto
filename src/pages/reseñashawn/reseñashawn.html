        The thing you need to know about Shawn Mendes is that he was a Vine kid. More importantly, he was one of those Vine kids who didn’t use the platform for tormenting unsuspecting parents or siblings, but rather used it mostly for showcasing musical talents that would have otherwise remained hidden. Armed with an acoustic guitar and a wide smile, Mendes would post short clips of him covering various Ed Sheeran, One Direction and 5 Seconds of Summer songs (and even a Beyoncé track thrown in here and there).</p>

      <p>The thing you need to know about Shawn Mendes is that he was a Vine kid. More importantly, he was one of those Vine kids who didn’t use the platform for tormenting unsuspecting parents or siblings, but rather used it mostly for showcasing musical talents that would have otherwise remained hidden. Armed with an acoustic guitar and a wide smile, Mendes would post short clips of him covering various Ed Sheeran, One Direction and 5 Seconds of Summer songs (and even a Beyoncé track thrown in here and there). His rise to fame started here, under the pastel green curl of Vine’s logo, vocals restricted to bite-sized, five-second long segments.It’s a shallow personability that has remained constant throughout his music, even as Mendes stepped away from Vine, entered into record contracts and started releasing original albums. His songs lack substance, depth or dynamism, instead just minute variations on the same easily-consumable, bred-for-radio sound that has been recycled throughout generations of generic pop stars from Ed Sheeran to Charlie Puth.</p>

      <p>To be fair, Mendes is not a bad artist. His vocal range is astounding, natural falsetto reaches add texture to every lackluster melody and, as he jumps from the smooth crescendo of the chorus into the abrupt “I could feel the tension / We could cut it with a knife” of verse one, Mendes is graceful, never allowing the delicate warmth of his voice to falter.</p>
